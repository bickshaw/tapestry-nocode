Page templates/classes amd even mixins seem pretty simple, but what's really going on in AppModule? 

Tapestry is built from many services that can be assembled in various ways. The Hotel Booking AppModule does a couple of things. First, it binds new services in the bind method. Services are generally singletons with an interface and an implementation. The interface is not really needed but allows some important features. It allows the service to be overridden, providing customization and better testing. It's also how class reloading works in development. As long as the interface does not change, the implementation can be changed without restarting the server. When in development mode, that's a huge time saver.

Many other methods add things to configurations, allowing an application to customize its environment. For example, contributing to the DefaultDataTypeAnalyzer maps string names to Java classes. The Hotel Booking application adds the types CreditCard and Address, thus extending the DefaultDataTypeAnalyzer knowledge of names for classes via a mapped configuration. 

There are two other types of configurations. The second type is just a set as demonstrated by BeanBlockSource, which returns an edit block for a string datatype. (Unordered configurations should be avoided because the can't be overridden.) This also shows how the services can work together. The DefaultDataTypeAnalyzer converts classes to names and the BeanBlockSource converts names to edit blocks. 

The third type of configuration is an ordered list. This is used for things like filters such as ComponentRequestHandler. For example, the authentication filter is configured to run before any other request filters.

There are hundreds of configurations that make up a running application. Many are defined by Tapestry itself, while others are added via modules. It's also possible for the application to define others. All of these together create a powerful, extensible and flexible system, but sometimes it's difficult to understand how the pieces relate to each other or even what the pieces are.

Tapestry 5.4 adds the ability to discover the configurations in a running system by adding a listener service to the ServiceConfigurationListenerHub. Normally, configurations are passed to the service named by the @Contribution and then discarded. Adding a listener allows other services access to all the configuration data and pull back the curtain on some of the magic.

Since this side trip does not have anything to do with Hotel Booking, it will go in a new module. Tapestry modules have the same structure as applications -- they are just packaged as jars and don't have a web.xml. First thing is to create a listener to capture the configurations, then a page to display them. The pages are exposed by contributing to the PageclassResolver.

[TapestryDocumentationModule.java](https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-documentation/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/tapestry/documentation/services/modules/TapestryDocumentationModule.java#L77-L82)

```java
@Contribute(ServiceConfigurationListenerHub.class)
public static void configureServiceConfigurationListener(OrderedConfiguration<ServiceConfigurationListener> configuration,
CatchAllServiceConfigurationListener listener)
{
  configuration.add("CatchAll", listener);
}
```
[CatchAllServiceConfigurationListener.java](https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-documentation/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/tapestry/documentation/services/CatchAllServiceConfigurationListener.java#L13)

```java

public class CatchAllServiceConfigurationListener implements ServiceConfigurationListener {
	private final Logger logger;

	private Map<ServiceDef,Object> configurations = new HashMap<ServiceDef,Object>();

	public CatchAllServiceConfigurationListener(Logger logger) {
		this.logger = logger;
	}


	public Collection<ServiceDef> getConfigurations() {
		return configurations.keySet();
	}

	public Entry<ServiceDef, Object> getConfigurationByID(String id) {
		for ( Entry<ServiceDef, Object> e : configurations.entrySet() ) {
			if ( e.getKey().getServiceId().equals(id)) {
				return e;
			}
		}

		return null;
	}

	@SuppressWarnings("rawtypes")
	@Override
	public void onMappedConfiguration(ServiceDef serviceDef, Map map) {
		logger.info("id: {} {}",serviceDef.getServiceId(),map);
		configurations.put(serviceDef, map);
	}

	@SuppressWarnings("rawtypes")
	@Override
	public void onOrderedConfiguration(ServiceDef serviceDef, List list) {
		configurations.put(serviceDef,list);
	}

	@SuppressWarnings("rawtypes")
	@Override
	public void onUnorderedConfiguration(ServiceDef serviceDef, Collection collection) {
		configurations.put(serviceDef,collection);

	}

}
```


The grid and beandisplay components make it easy to display the list of configurations, and display each one without knowing anything about a serviceDef. Going to the page reveals about 40 different configurations. Hitting refresh reveals even more because the services are lazy loaded. 

Even when Tapestry creates a service with dependencies, the dependencies are not created until called. This is accomplished by inserting a proxy instead of the actual object. As seen in the grid, there is a way to override this behavior by setting the eagerLoad property on the service. 

By default, services are singletons as indicated by the scope property. It's also possible to create perThread services if state needs to be maintained at the request level. The view link shows the same data plus the markers and the configuration. Markers can be used to differentiate services with the same interface. 

Finally, there are the configurations. 

For some services it's obvious what the configuration is for. Looking at the DefaultDataTypeAnalyzer, it's pretty clear the configuration maps classes to names, but there is also a datatypeAnalyzer that's ordered and contains the DefaultDataTypeAnalyzer. This is the service that actually maps types to names, and it's made up of an ordered configuration of datatypeAnalyzers. 

Tapestry takes this configuration and builds a chain service from all the contributions. This allows creating new types of datatypeAnalyzers or overriding the behavior of other by inserting a new service higher in the chain. Tapestry supports four kinds of service builders Chain, Pipeline, Shadow and Strategy to aid in solving various kinds of problems in extensible ways.

[ConfigurationIndex.java](https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-documentation/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/tapestry/documentation/pages/configuration/ConfigurationIndex.java#L13)

```java
public class ConfigurationIndex {

	public static Class<ConfigurationView> view = ConfigurationView.class;

	@Inject
	DocumentationResources<ServiceDef> documentationResources;

	@Property
	Collection<ServiceDef> collection;
	@Property
	ServiceDef serviceDef;

	@BeginRender
	void beginRender() {
		collection = documentationResources.getConfigurations();
	}

	public String getJavaDoc() {
		return documentationResources.getDocumentation(serviceDef).getJavaDoc();
	}

	public ConfigurationType getConfigType() {
		return documentationResources.getConfigurationType(serviceDef);
	}


}
```

Since this is called the documentation module, it would be nice to integrate with the Javadoc. There are various ways to do this but the simplest might be to build a service that takes an object and returns the URL to the Javadoc. But there is a problem. 

Most of the objects are from Tapestry and require linking to Tapestry javadocs, but some are from the Hotel Booking application. The documentation module adds even more. How can a single service handle all three, plus others that could be added by other modules? The chainBuilder service solves this problem just like it does for the datatypeAnalyzer by creating a chain each module can contribute a service that maps objects to URLs
