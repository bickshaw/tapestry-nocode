The prototype meets the main requirement for the app but without some kind of authentication it's just a prototype. Tapestry does not provide authentication out of the box but does provide the parts to implement it. The requirements here are simple but security is hard plus the least code solution is often just a jar file away. The Apache Shiro project provides a general purposes authentication/authorization library and the Tynamo Security module adds Tapestry integration. Just like Tapestry provides modules such as Hibernate, 3rd party modules are an easy way to just drop in functionality.


The Tynamo Security module integrates Apache Shiro with Tapestry providing access control the pages, components and methods. It's pretty easy to set up and flexible enough for almost any application. It supports both role based and permission based security and can map to almost any data model.

Setting up Tynamo security is much simpler than creating security from scratch all that's needed is a class that extends AuthorizingRealm, a bit of configuration and then contribute that Realm to the WebSecurityManager.class. Shiro provides a JDBC realm which can be used as an example to create a HibernateRealm. The data model consists of users, roles and permissions with many to many relationships. The password and salt are stored in the user entity. The only real trick here is getting the authentication setup correctly. The HashCredentials manager handles the base64 encoded password and expects a byte[] for the salt. In order to successfully authenticate  the newUser method, the realm and the AppModule config need to be in sync. Users are created with the "user" role and that role is required for the booking page.

[HibernateRealm.java](https://github.com/trsvax/HotelBooking/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/hotelbooking/services/hibernate/HibernateRealm.java#L20)

```java
package com.trsvax.hotelbooking.services.hibernate;


public class HibernateRealm extends AuthorizingRealm {

	private final UserService userService;

	public HibernateRealm(UserService userService) {
		this.userService = userService;
	}

	@Override
	protected AuthorizationInfo doGetAuthorizationInfo(@NotNull PrincipalCollection principals) {

		String principal = (String) getAvailablePrincipal(principals);

		User user = userService.getUserForPrincipal(principal);
		Set<String> roleNames = user.roles.stream().map(a -> a.role).collect(Collectors.toSet());
		Set<String> permissions = user.permissions.stream().map(a -> a.permission).collect(Collectors.toSet());

		SimpleAuthorizationInfo info = new SimpleAuthorizationInfo(roleNames);
		info.setStringPermissions(permissions);
		return info;
	}


	@Override
	protected AuthenticationInfo doGetAuthenticationInfo(AuthenticationToken token) throws AuthenticationException {
		String principal = ((UsernamePasswordToken) token).getUsername();

		User user = userService.getUserForPrincipal(principal);

		return userService.getAuthenticationInfo(user, getName());
	}

}
```

[AppModule.java](https://github.com/trsvax/HotelBooking/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/hotelbooking/services/AppModule.java#L99-L104)

```java
@Contribute(WebSecurityManager.class)
public static void addRealms(Configuration<Realm> configuration,
    @Autobuild HibernateRealm realm, UserService userService) {
  realm.setCredentialsMatcher(userService.getCredentialsMatcher());
  configuration.add(realm);
}
```

With the setup done it's time to protect some resources. This can be done via Annotations, configuration or code. Code is easy enough just use the Shiro api but for this project code is the last resort. It's also possible to protect URLs with wild cards. This is a good way to add some fail safe security to the application such are requiring the admin role for any URL starting with /admin. For this application Annotations are the preferred choice. The module provides several in this case the BookingNew page requires a user role so add @RequiresRole to the page class.

[BookingNew.java](https://github.com/trsvax/HotelBooking/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/hotelbooking/pages/hotel/booking/BookingNew.java#L14)

      @RequiresRoles("user")
      public class BookingNew {

Here is where security starts to get tricky. While it's best if the page requires a user role for access the real requirement is a user role is required to create a new booking. It's also possible to annotate methods. In this case the onSuccess method needs to validate the user role but the real requirement for a user is in the Hotel service newBooking method. The method takes a hotel and booking objects and returns a status. The method also requires a user role so add it there also.

[HotelServiceImpl.java](https://github.com/trsvax/HotelBooking/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/hotelbooking/services/HotelServiceImpl.java#L27)

      @RequiresRoles("user")
      public String newBooking(Booking booking)


Tynamo Security is simple, flexible and extensible.  There is really no reason to use anything else. Even in this simple case it would have been easy to overlook the most important security requirement by just protecting the page not the method. The Tynamo Security module provides a concise no code way to protect all kinds of resources. Using annotations to declare the security of a resource fits in perfectly with Tapestry because it makes it easy to determine if a user has access to a resource without actually requesting it. This makes it possible to build a website that adapts to the roles/permission of a user.
